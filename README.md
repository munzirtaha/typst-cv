## Usage

1. Install Typst on your system if you haven't already.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Modify the `cv.typ` file with your personal information and CV content.
4. Run `typst c cv.typ` to generate your CV.

## Customization

### Colors

To change the color scheme, modify the following lines in `lib.typ`:

```typst
#let primary-color = rgb("#0395DE")
#let secondary-color = gray
```

### Fonts

The template uses a combination of fonts that can be easily customized. To change the fonts, modify the following in `cv.typ`:

```typst
font: ("Libertinus Serif", "Noto Color Emoji", "Symbols Nerd Font"))
```

The [Symbols Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) can be easily replaced with other icon fonts like FontAwesome, lucide, Academicons, etc. Alternatively, they might be appended to the list as fallback fonts. This allows you to use different icon sets in your CV without changing the overall structure.
